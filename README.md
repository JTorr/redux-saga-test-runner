# redux-saga-test-runner

On my team at work, we found that while redux-saga makes testing very nice, our
tests were still very coupled to the implementation. If we changed the order of
any of the steps in our sagas, our tests would fail unnecessarily. This allows
the tests to be written in a generic way so the saga's behavior is tested, not
the exact implementation.
